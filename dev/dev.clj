  ;; Use eval with a quoted Wolfram-as-clojure-data expression (`Fn[..]` becoming `(Fn ..)`):
  (wl/eval '(Dot [1 2 3] [4 5 6])) ; Wolfram: `Dot[{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}]]`
  (wl/eval (Dot [1 2 3] [4 5 6])) ; We have loaded all symbols as Clojure fns and thus can run this directly

  (wl/eval '(N Pi 20))
  (wl/eval (N 'Pi 20)) ; Beware: Pi must still be quoted, it is not a fn
