(k/md "# Wolframite for Clojure developers {#sec-for-developers}

This section is intended for you, a developer familiar with Clojure, who may know little or nothing about Wolfram.

You may decide whether you want to learn a little about Wolfram first in @sec-wolfram-for-clojurians or jump right to
an example analysis of data with Wolfram in @sec-demo-analysis-cycling.")
