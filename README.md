# Wolframite

An interface between Clojure and the Wolfram Language (Supports [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) and [Wolfram Engine](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/) ).

## Status

**Wolframite is currently (Q2/2024) under active development again. You can [keep track of what is happening in this discussion](https://github.com/scicloj/wolframite/discussions/17).**

## What is Wolframite? ##

Wolframite (formerly Clojuratica) brings together two of today's most exciting tools for high-performance, parallel computation.

[Clojure](http://clojure.org) is a dynamic functional programming language with a compelling approach to concurrency and state, a strong cast of persistent immutable data structures, and a growing reputation for doing all the right things.
[Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) is arguably the world's most powerful integrated tool for numerical computation, symbolic mathematics, optimization, and visualization and is build on top of its own splendid functional programming language, [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/).

By linking the two:

* Wolframite lets you **write and evaluate Wolfram/Mathematica code in Clojure** with full **syntactic integration**. Now Clojure programs can take advantage of Wolfram's enormous range of numerical and symbolic mathematics algorithms and fast matrix algebra routines.
* Wolframite provides the **seamless and transparent translation of native data structures** between Clojure and Wolfram. This includes high-precision numbers, matricies, N-dimensional arrays, and evaluated and unevaluated Mathematica expressions and formulae.
* Wolframite lets you **call, pass, and store Wolfram functions just as if they were first-class functions in Clojure.** This is high-level functional programming at its finest. You can write a function in whichever language is more suited to the task and never think again about which platform is evaluating calls to that function.
* Wolframite facilitates **the "Clojurization" of Wolfram's existing parallel-computing capabilities.** Wolfram is not designed for threads or concurrency. It has excellent support for parallel computation, but parallel evaluations are initiated from a single-threaded master kernel which blocks until all parallel evaluations return. By contrast, Wolframite includes a concurrency framework that lets multiple Clojure threads execute Wolfram expressions without blocking others. Now it is easy to run a simulation in Clojure with 1,000 independent threads asynchronously evaluating processor-intensive expressions in Wolfram. The computations will be farmed out adaptively and transparently to however many Wolfram kernels are available on any number of processor cores, either locally or across a cluster, grid, or network.

Wolframite is open-source and targeted at applications in scientific computing, computational economics, finance, and other fields that rely on the combination of parallelized simulation and high-performance number-crunching. Wolframite gives the programmer access to Clojure's most cutting-edge features--easy concurrency and multithreading, immutable persistent data structures, and software transactional memory---alongside Wolfram's easy-to-use algorithms for numerics, symbolic mathematics, optimization, statistics, visualization, and image-processing.

## Usage

### Prerequisites:

#### Clojure

First, if you haven't already, install the [Clojure CLI toolchain](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) (homebrew is a great way to do this if you're on Mac or Linux, but you can just as easily use the installation scripts if you prefer).

#### Mathematica or Wolfram Engine

Next, obviously, you'll need to ensure that you have Wolfram Engine or Mathematica installed and your license (free for W. E.) registered - make sure you can run these tools on their own before trying Wolframite.

First of all, you need to initialize a connecting to a Wolfram/Mathematica kernel, like this:

```clojure
(wolframite.core/init!)
```
This should also find and load the JLink JAR included with your installation. Watch stdout for a message like:

> === Adding path to classpath: /Applications/Wolfram Engine.app/Contents/Resources/Wolfram Player.app/Contents/SystemFiles/Links/JLink/JLink.jar ===

However, sometimes Wolframite may fail to find the correct path automatically and needs your help. You can set the `WOLFRAM_INSTALL_PATH` environment variable or Java system property (the latter takes priority) to point to the correct location. Example:

```shell
export WOLFRAM_INSTALL_PATH=/opt/mathematica/13.1
```

### Getting started

Start a REPL with Wolframite on the classpath, then initialize it:

```clojure
(require '[wolframite.core :as wl])
;; Initialize
(wl/init!) ; => nil
;; Make all Wolfram functions available as symbols in the current ns (takes some seconds!):
(wl/load-all-symbols (symbol (ns-name *ns*)))
;; Use it:
(wl/eval '(Dot [1 2 3] [4 5 6]))
;=> 32
```

More examples

```clojure
(wl/eval '(D (Power 'x 2) 'x))
;=> (* 2 x)
(wl/eval '(ChemicalData "Ethanol" "MolarMass"))
;=> (Quantity 46.069M (* "Grams" (Power "Moles" -1)))

;; Accessing WlframAlpha
(wl/eval '(WolframAlpha "How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop?"))
;=> [(-> [["Input" 1] "Plaintext"] "How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?") (-> [["Result" 1] "Plaintext"] "3481\n(according to student researchers at the University of Cambridge)")]
; FIXME Try this out; when offline, we get just []

(wl/eval '(N Pi 20))
(N 'Pi 20)
;=> 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820285M
```

#### Learning Wolframite

Read through and play with [explainer.clj](dev%2Fexplainer.clj) and [demo.clj](dev%2Fdemo.clj), which demonstrate most of Wolframite's features and what you can do with Wolfram.

### Clerk Integration

Example usage: (watching for changes in a folder)

```
user> (require '[clojuratica.tools.clerk-helper :as ch])
user> (ch/clerk-watch! ["dev/notebook"])
```

* Open dev/notebook/demo.clj, make a change and save.
* Open `localhost:7777` in the browser

## Dependencies

Wolframite requires Wolfram's Java integration library JLink, which is currently only available with a Wolfram Engine or Mathematica installation. It will also need to know where the `WolframKernel` / `MathKernel` executable is, in order to be able to start the external evaluation kernel process. Normally, `wolframite.jlink` should be able to find these automatically, if you installed either into a standard location on Mac, Linux or Windows. However, if necessary, you can specify either with env variables / sys properties - see Prerequisites above.

## Development

### Running tests

To run tests from the command line, you need to add JLink to the classpath (only REPL supports dynamically loading jars) -
create a `./symlink-jlink.jar` symlink and then run the tests:

```shell
clojure -X:test-run
```
