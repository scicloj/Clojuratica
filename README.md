# Wolframite

An interface between Clojure and the Wolfram Language (Supports [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) and [Wolfram Engine](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/) ).

## Status

**Wolframite is currently (Q2/2024) under active development again. You can [keep track of what is happening in this discussion](https://github.com/scicloj/wolframite/discussions/17).**

## What is Wolframite? ##

Wolframite (formerly Clojuratica) brings together two of today's most exciting tools for high-performance, parallel computation.

[Clojure](http://clojure.org) is a dynamic functional programming language with a compelling approach to concurrency and state, a strong cast of persistent immutable data structures, and a growing reputation for doing all the right things.
[Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) is arguably the world's most powerful integrated tool for numerical computation, symbolic mathematics, optimization, and visualization and is build on top of its own splendid functional programming language, [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/).

By linking the two:

* Wolframite lets you **write and evaluate Wolfram/Mathematica code in Clojure** with full **syntactic integration**. Now Clojure programs can take advantage of Wolfram's enormous range of numerical and symbolic mathematics algorithms and fast matrix algebra routines.
* Wolframite provides the **seamless and transparent translation of native data structures** between Clojure and Wolfram. This includes high-precision numbers, matricies, N-dimensional arrays, and evaluated and unevaluated Mathematica expressions and formulae.
* Wolframite lets you **write Wolfram as if it was Clojure** by providing Clojure functions and vars for all Wolfram symbols, including docstrings and autocompletion in your favorite IDE
* [Tentative] Wolframite facilitates **the "Clojurization" of Wolfram's existing parallel-computing capabilities.** Wolfram is not designed for threads or concurrency. It has excellent support for parallel computation, but parallel evaluations are initiated from a single-threaded master kernel which blocks until all parallel evaluations return. By contrast, Wolframite includes a concurrency framework that lets multiple Clojure threads execute Wolfram expressions without blocking others. Now it is easy to run a simulation in Clojure with 1,000 independent threads asynchronously evaluating processor-intensive expressions in Wolfram. The computations will be farmed out adaptively and transparently to however many Wolfram kernels are available on any number of processor cores, either locally or across a cluster, grid, or network.
  * Notice that you cannot run more Wolfram kernels than your license allows (see `wolframite/kernel-info!`) 

Wolframite is open-source and targeted at applications in scientific computing, computational economics, finance, and other fields that rely on the combination of parallelized simulation and high-performance number-crunching. Wolframite gives the programmer access to Clojure's most cutting-edge features--easy concurrency and multithreading, immutable persistent data structures, and software transactional memory---alongside Wolfram's easy-to-use algorithms for numerics, symbolic mathematics, optimization, statistics, visualization, and image-processing.

## Usage

### Prerequisites:

#### Clojure

First, if you haven't already, install the [Clojure CLI toolchain](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) (homebrew is a great way to do this if you're on Mac or Linux, but you can just as easily use the installation scripts if you prefer).

#### Mathematica or Wolfram Engine

Next, obviously, you'll need to ensure that you have Wolfram Engine or Mathematica installed and your license (free for W. E.) registered - make sure you can run these tools on their own _before_ trying Wolframite.

First of all, you need to initialize a connection to a Wolfram/Mathematica kernel, like this:

```clojure
(wolframite.core/init!)
```
This should also find and load the JLink JAR included with your installation. Watch stdout for an INFO log message (via clojure.tools.logging) like:

> === Adding path to classpath: /Applications/Wolfram Engine.app/Contents/Resources/Wolfram Player.app/Contents/SystemFiles/Links/JLink/JLink.jar ===

However, sometimes Wolframite may fail to find the correct path automatically and needs your help. You can set the `WOLFRAM_INSTALL_PATH` environment variable or Java system property (the latter takes priority) to point to the correct location. Example:

```shell
export WOLFRAM_INSTALL_PATH=/opt/mathematica/13.1
```

### Getting started

Start a REPL with Wolframite on the classpath, then initialize it:

```clojure
(require '[wolframite.core :as wl] 
         '[wolframite.wolfram :as w]) ; Wolfram symbols as Clojure vars / fns
;; Initialize
(wl/init!) ; => nil
;; Use it:
(wl/eval (w/Dot [1 2 3] [4 5 6]))
;=> 32
```

More examples

```clojure
(wl/eval (w/D (w/Power 'x 2) 'x))
;=> (* 2 x)
(wl/eval (w/ChemicalData "Ethanol" "MolarMass"))
;=> (Quantity 46.069M (* "Grams" (Power "Moles" -1)))

;; Accessing WlframAlpha
(wl/eval (w/WolframAlpha "How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop?")) ; BEWARE: must be online
;=> [(-> [["Input" 1] "Plaintext"] "How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?") (-> [["Result" 1] "Plaintext"] "3481\n(according to student researchers at the University of Cambridge)")]

(wl/eval (w/N w/Pi 20))
;=> 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820285M

(wl/eval (w/Map (w/fn [x] (w/Sqrt x)) [4 16]))
;=> [2 4]
```

TIP: Cursive - teach it to resolve `w/fn` as `clojure.core/fn`.

NOTE: The `wolframite.wolfram` (`w`) ns has vars for all Wolfram symbols at the time of the last release. Check `w/*wolfram-kernel-name*` for kernel type/version and run `(wolframite.impl.wolfram-syms.write-ns/write-ns!)`
to generate your own wolfram ns with whatever additional symbols your Wolfram/Mathematice has.

#### Learning Wolframite

Read through and play with [explainer.clj](dev%2Fexplainer.clj) and [demo.clj](dev%2Fdemo.clj), which demonstrate most of Wolframite's features and what you can do with Wolfram.

#### Customizing Wolframite

A big advantage of Wolframite (as opposed to its earlier incarnations) is that we can now individually tailor the user experience at the level of initialization,
```clojure
(wl/init! {:aliases '{** Power}})
(wl/eval '(** 2 5)) ; => 32
```
,
and function call,
```clojure
(wl/init!)
(wl/eval '(** 2 5) {:aliases '{** Power}}) ; => 32
```
. Use it how you want to!

### Clerk Integration

Example usage: (watching for changes in a folder)

```
user> (require '[clojuratica.tools.clerk-helper :as ch])
user> (ch/clerk-watch! ["dev/notebook"])
```

* Open dev/notebook/demo.clj, make a change and save.
* Open `localhost:7777` in the browser

### How does it work?

You compose Wolfram expressions using the convenience functions and vars from `wolframite.wolfram`. These are then turned first into a symbolic representation of themselves and later into a tree of JLink `Expr` objects and sent to a Wolfram kernel subprocess (started by `wl/init!`) for evaluation. The result is translated back from jlink.Expr into a Clojure form. This translation allows for some additional convenience logic, such as supporting `w/*` instead of `Times`.

## Dependencies

Wolframite requires Wolfram's Java integration library JLink, which is currently only available with a Wolfram Engine or Mathematica installation. It will also need to know where the `WolframKernel` / `MathKernel` executable is, in order to be able to start the external evaluation kernel process. Normally, `wl/init!` should be able to find these automatically, if you installed either into a standard location on Mac, Linux or Windows. However, if necessary, you can specify either with env variables / sys properties - see Prerequisites above.

## Development

### Running tests

To run tests from the command line, you need to add JLink to the classpath (only REPL supports dynamically loading jars) -
create a `./symlink-jlink.jar` symlink and then run the tests:

```shell
clojure -X:test-run
```
